\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

This document grew out of notes I took during a course on homological algebra, taught by Prof.\ Tobias Dyckerhoff, and algebraic topology, taught by Prof.\ Birgit Richter, during Summer Semester 2019 at the University of Hamburg.

\hyperref[part:homological_algebra]{Part~\ref*{part:homological_algebra}}, on homological algebra, is fairly close to the course taught by Prof.\ Dyckerhoff, but \hyperref[part:algebraic_topology]{Part~\ref*{part:algebraic_topology}} departs somewhat from the approach taken by Prof.\ Richter, mainly because of the level of homological algebra at our disposal.
